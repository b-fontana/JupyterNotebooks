### **Exploratory data analysis**

When analyzing a dataset with multiple entries, each with multiple variables, one can look for correlations. Try selecting a region on one of the plots below to display the other variables corresponding to the same entries.

{% include explore-one.html %}

Alternatively the selection can be done with sliders:

{% include explore-two.html %}

You can now start experimenting your own [custom selections](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/interaction/callbacks.html#customjs-for-selections) with the [available widgets](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/interaction/widgets.html).
