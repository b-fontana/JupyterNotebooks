Description: *We discuss and justify the application of Python's Bokeh library to non-interactive and interactive visualization. A comparison between Bokeh and some widely used alternatives is made. We include a tutorial covering the key aspects necessary to create virtually any interactive plot needed in HEP, and provide custom examples and code.*

The material includes three notebooks:
- ```Motivation.ipynb```: why ```bokeh``` is very competitive
- ```InteractivePlotting.ipynb```: how to perform interactions with ```bokeh```
- ```CustomExample1.ipynb```: example of exploratory data analysis

An additional example (```CustomExample2.py```, referring to astrophysical spectra generation) is provided in pure ```python``` format only given its large size. To visualize its output click [here](https://b-fontana.github.io/).
